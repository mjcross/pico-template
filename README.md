# pico-template
This repository provides a simple template project for developing with the RPi Pico (RP2040) in Visual Studio Code on MacOS.

The project configures VS Code to program and debug the target device via its SWD pins by using another Pico as a USB/SWD bridge (see [Picoprobe](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picoprobe)).

Note that for this to work VS Code needs a couple of external tools and plug-ins (e.g. see instructions [here](https://www.digikey.be/en/maker/projects/raspberry-pi-pico-and-rp2040-cc-part-2-debugging-with-vs-code/470abc7efb07432b82c95f6f67f184c0)).
